# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview  
This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various health parameters. The model is trained using classification algorithms and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset  
**Source:** Kaggle  
**Number of Samples:** 303  
**Target Variable:** `target` (1 = Heart disease, 0 = No heart disease)  

## Features:  
| Feature   | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `age`     | Age of the patient |
| `sex`     | Gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female) |
| `cp`      | Chest pain type (0-3, where 3 is most severe) |
| `trestbps` | Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) |
| `chol`    | Serum cholesterol (mg/dL) |
| `fbs`     | Fasting blood sugar (1 = > 120 mg/dL, 0 = Normal) |
| `restecg` | Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2) |
| `thalach` | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| `exang`   | Exercise-induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| `oldpeak` | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest |
| `slope`   | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2) |
| `ca`      | Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy |
| `thal`    | Thalassemia (0-3, where 3 is abnormal) |
